/**
 * Wave-based BFS dependency resolver.
 *
 * Processes dependencies in breadth-first waves -- each wave batches all
 * unresolved packages at the current frontier, fetches their metadata in
 * parallel, discovers new dependencies, and repeats until the queue is empty.
 *
 * Public API:
 *   resolveWave()          - Run the BFS resolution loop
 *   buildInstallContexts() - Convert the graph into pipeline-ready contexts
 *   updateWorkspaceIndex() - Post-install index update
 */
