# OpenPackage

OpenPackage turns your AI coding setups into reusable modules that anyone can instantly install to any platform, any codebase, ensuring consistent workflows across projects and teams.

## Why OpenPackage?

Modern AI coding tools are powerful, but lack organization, reusability, and efficiency.
- Rules, commands, subagents, and skills scattered across multiple projects.
- Familiar workflows rebuilt for each project, incompatible between AI coding platforms.
- Specs across individuals and codebases, diverging, unversioned, and incohesive.

OpenPackage takes care of cross-platform conversions, config composition, and portability, freeing you to build more, faster.

- Install & sync pre-built workflows to speed up coding. No more reinventing the wheel.
- Reuse rules, slash commands, and skills across multiple codebases and platforms.
- Share and compose packages together to create powerful workflows that continuously evolve.

## Use cases

- Install Claude Code Plugins to any coding platform
- Sync specs, rules, commands, agents, skills, and MCPs across platforms
- Reuse files and configs across multiple codebases
- Modular management of configs and specs

## How it works

At its core, OpenPackage is a lightweight CLI tool for creating versioned, AI coding platform agnostic packages, each contaning sets of coding config files and specs for simplified installs, uninstalls, and distribution.  

It's basically Claude Code Plugins, but universal, more powerful, and open source.

1. Declare a package
2. Add rules, commands, subagents, skills, mcp configs, specs, docs etc.
3. Install and sync to multiple codebases

## Quick start

### Install

npm
```bash
npm install -g opkg 
```

### Install packages
```bash title="Terminal"
opkg install <package>
```  
Installs all files from a package into the codebase at cwd, formatted and converted to per platform conventions and into their respective dirs.

The install command supports various package sources:
```bash title="Terminal"
opkg install essentials               # Local/remote registry
opkg install ../packages/essentials/  # Local path

# GitHub package repo
opkg install git:https://github.com/enulus/awesome-openpackage.git    

# GitHub Claude Code Plugins marketplace
opkg install github:anthropics/claude-code
```

For marketplaces, use `--plugins` (or `-p`) to install specific plugins non-interactively:
```bash title="Terminal"
# Install specific plugins by name (bypasses interactive selection)
opkg install github:anthropics/claude-code --plugins plugin1,plugin2

# Short flag with multiple plugins
opkg install github:user/marketplace -p "plugin-a, plugin-b, plugin-c"
```

Use the `--global` (or `-g`) option to install files to user scope:
```bash title="Terminal"
# Installs to home dir, ex: ~/.cursor/, ~/.opencode/
opkg install github:anthropics/claude-code -g
```  

### Show installed packages and files
```bash title="Terminal"
opkg status             # Lists packages installed to workspace at cwd
opkg status <package>   # Lists installed files for specified package
```  
Use the status command to show an overview of packages and files installed.

### Uninstall packages
```bash title="Terminal"
opkg uninstall <package>
```  
Removes all files for a package from the codebase at cwd.

> Learn more by heading over to the [official docs](https://openpackage.dev/docs).

### Compose a package

```bash title="Terminal"
opkg new <package>
```

Then manually add/update/remove files to and from the package following this structure:

```txt title="Structure"
<package>
│   
│   # Package files
├── openpackage.yml       # The OpenPackage manifest, required
├── README.md             # LICENSE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, etc.
│   
│   # Content files
├── rules/                # Rule files
├── commands/             # Command files (slash commands)
├── agents/               # Agent files (subagents)
├── skills/               # Skill files (skills)
├── root/                 # Any other root dirs or files (Ex: specs/, docs/, tests/, etc.)
├── AGENTS.md             # Platform root file
├── mcp.jsonc             # MCP config file
│   
│   # Custom files
└── <other>               # Customizable via `platforms.jsonc` overrides/extensions
```

You can also use the `add` and `remove` commands to add/remove files to/from a package.

```bash title="Terminal"
opkg add <package> .cursor/commands/clean.md    # Adds workspace file or dir to package
opkg remove <package> commands/clean.md         # Removes file or dir from package
```

> Learn more about packages from the [packages doc](https://openpackage.dev/docs/packages) on our official docs.

## Supported Platforms

OpenPackage performs installation and platform sync of files for supported AI coding platforms outlined by the table below.  

| Platform | Directory | Root file | Rules | Commands | Agents | Skills | MCP |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Antigravity | .agent/ | | rules/ | workflows/ | | skills/ | |
| Augment Code | .augment/ | | rules/ | commands/ | | | |
| Claude Code | .claude/ | CLAUDE.md | rules/ | commands/ | agents/ | skills/ | .mcp.json (root) |
| Codex | .codex/ | AGENTS.md | | prompts/ | | skills/ | config.toml |
| Cursor | .cursor/ | AGENTS.md | rules/ | commands/ | agents/ | skills/ | mcp.json |
| Factory | .factory/ | AGENTS.md | | commands/ | droids/ | skills/ | mcp.json |
| Kilo Code | .kilocode/ | AGENTS.md | rules/ | workflows/ | | skills/ | mcp.json |
| Kiro | .kiro/ | | steering/ | | | | settings/mcp.json |
| OpenCode | .opencode/ | AGENTS.md | | command/ | agent/ | skills/ | opencode.json |
| Pi-Mono | .pi/ | AGENTS.md | | agent/prompts/ | | agent/skills/ | |
| Qwen Code | .qwen/ | QWEN.md | | | agents/ | skills/ | settings.json |
| Roo | .roo/ | AGENTS.md | | commands/ | | skills/ | mcp.json |
| Warp | .warp/ | WARP.md | | | | |
| Windsurf | .windsurf/ | | rules/ | | | skills/ | |

The built-in `platforms.jsonc` defines supported platforms, but can be overridden by user configs:
- Global: `~/.openpackage/platforms.jsonc` (`.json`)
- Workspace: `<cwd>/.openpackage/platforms.jsonc` (`.json`)

Deep-merged (local > global > built-in) for per-project customization.
