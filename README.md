# OpenPackage

OpenPackage transforms your AI coding setups into one-click, reusable modules—shareable across projects and teams for consistent workflows. **No API keys required. No MCP setup.** 

## Why OpenPackage?

Modern AI coding tools are powerful, but lack organization, reusability, and efficiency.
- Rules, commands, and subagents scattered across multiple projects.
- Familiar workflows rebuilt for each project, incompatible between AI coding platforms.
- Specs across individuals and codebases, diverging, unversioned, and incohesive.

OpenPackage organizes your AI coding configs and specs into reusable packages that can be accessed by any project and any coding platform.

- Install & sync pre-built workflows to speed up coding. No more reinventing the wheel.
- Reuse rules, slash commands, and skills across multiple codebases and platforms.
- Share and compose packages together to create powerful workflows that continuously evolve.

## How it works

At its core, OpenPackage is a lightweight CLI tool for creating versioned, AI coding platform agnostic packages, each contaning sets of specs and coding config files for simplified installs, uninstalls, and distribution.

1. Declare a package
2. Add rules, commands, subagents, skills, mcp configs, specs, docs etc.
3. Install and sync to multiple codebases

## Use cases

- Install Claude Code Plugins to any coding platform
- Reuse files and configs across multiple codebases
- Sync configs across multiple platforms
- Modular management of specs, rules, commands, agents, skills, and MCPs

## Quick start

### Install

npm
```bash
npm install -g opkg 
```

### Compose a package

```bash title="Terminal"
opkg new <package>
```

Then manually add/update/remove files to and from the package following this structure:

```txt title="Structure"
<package>
│   
│   # Package files
├── openpackage.yml       # The OpenPackage manifest, required
├── README.md             # LICENSE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, etc.
│   
│   # Content files
├── rules/                # Rule files
├── commands/             # Command files (slash commands)
├── agents/               # Agent files (subagents)
├── skills/               # Skill files (skills)
├── root/                 # Any other root dirs or files (Ex: specs/, docs/, tests/, etc.)
├── AGENTS.md             # Platform root file
├── mcp.jsonc             # MCP config file
│   
│   # Custom files
└── <other>               # Customizable via `platforms.jsonc` overrides/extensions
```

You can also use the `add` and `remove` commands to add/remove files to/from a package.

```bash title="Terminal"
opkg add <package> .cursor/commands/clean.md    # Adds workspace file or dir to package
opkg remove <package> commands/clean.md         # Removes file or dir from package
```  

> [!TIP]  
> Learn more about packages from the [packages doc](https://openpackage.dev/docs/packages) on our official docs.

### Install packages
```bash title="Terminal"
opkg install <package>
```  
Installs all files from a package into the codebase at cwd, formatted and converted to per platform conventions and into their respective dirs.

The install command supports various package sources:
```bash title="Terminal"
opkg install essentials               # Local/remote registry
opkg install ../packages/essentials/  # Local path
opkg install github:https://github.com/enulus/awesome-openpackage.git   # GitHub package repo
opkg install github:https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code.git       # GitHub Claude Code Plugins marketplace
```  


### Uninstall packages
```bash title="Terminal"
opkg uninstall <package>
```  
Removes all files for a package from the codebase at cwd.

## Supported Platforms

OpenPackage performs installation and platform sync of files for supported AI coding platforms outlined by the table below.  

| Platform | Directory | Root file | Rules | Commands | Agents | Skills | MCP |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Antigravity | .agent/ | | rules/ | workflows/ |  | | |
| Augment Code | .augment/ | | rules/ | commands/ |  | | |
| Claude Code | .claude/ | CLAUDE.md | | commands/ | agents/ | skills/ | .mcp.json |
| Codex | .codex/ | AGENTS.md | | prompts/ | | | |
| Cursor | .cursor/ | AGENTS.md | rules/ | commands/ | | | mcp.json |
| Factory | .factory/ | AGENTS.md | | commands/ | droids/ | | |
| Kilo Code | .kilocode/ | AGENTS.md | rules/ | workflows/ | |  | |
| Kiro | .kiro/ | | steering/ |  | | | |
| OpenCode | .opencode/ | AGENTS.md | | command/ | agent/ | skills/ | opencode.json |
| Qwen Code | .qwen/ | QWEN.md | | | agents/ | | |
| Roo | .roo/ | AGENTS.md | | commands/ | | | |
| Warp | .warp/ | WARP.md | | | | |
| Windsurf | .windsurf/ | | rules/ |  | | | |

The built-in `platforms.jsonc` defines supported platforms, but can be overridden by user configs:
- Global: `~/.openpackage/platforms.jsonc` (`.json`)
- Workspace: `<cwd>/.openpackage/platforms.jsonc` (`.json`)

Deep-merged (local > global > built-in) for per-project customization.
