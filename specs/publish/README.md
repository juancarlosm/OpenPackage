# Publish Command

`opkg publish` publishes packages to either the remote OpenPackage registry (default) or local registry (with `--local` flag). It supports flexible package input (package names, paths, or current directory) and provides comprehensive output formatting.

## Purpose & Direction
- **Default (Remote)**: Publishes package to remote OpenPackage registry (requires authentication)
- **Local Mode**: Publishes package to local registry (`~/.openpackage/registry/`)
- **Flexible Input**: Accepts package names, directory paths, or defaults to current directory

## Publishing Modes

### Remote Publishing (Default)
```bash
opkg publish                    # Publish CWD to remote registry
opkg publish my-package         # Publish named package to remote registry
opkg publish ./path/to/package  # Publish from path to remote registry
```

- **Destination**: Remote OpenPackage registry
- **Authentication**: Required (via profile or API key)
- **Network**: HTTPS upload to backend
- **Use Case**: Distribution to community, public sharing

### Local Publishing
```bash
opkg publish --local            # Publish CWD to local registry
opkg publish my-package --local # Publish named package to local
opkg publish ./path/to/package --local  # Publish from path to local
```

- **Destination**: Local registry (`~/.openpackage/registry/`)
- **Authentication**: Not required
- **Network**: Local filesystem only
- **Use Case**: Local development, testing, sharing packages across projects

## Package Input Resolution

The publish command accepts flexible package input:

1. **No argument** (default): Publishes from current working directory
   ```bash
   cd ~/my-package
   opkg publish
   ```

2. **Package name**: Resolves package by name from multiple locations
   ```bash
   opkg publish my-package  # Searches: CWD → Workspace → Global
   ```
   - **CWD**: If current directory contains matching package name
   - **Workspace**: `~/.openpackage/packages/<name>/`
   - **Global**: `~/.openpackage/packages/<name>/` (global installs)

3. **Directory path**: Direct path to package directory
   ```bash
   opkg publish ./packages/my-package  # Relative path
   opkg publish /abs/path/to/package   # Absolute path
   ```

4. **Rejected inputs**: Tarball and git URLs are explicitly rejected with helpful error messages

### Resolution Transparency
When resolving by package name, publish shows where the package was found:
```
✓ Found my-package in workspace packages
```

## Flow

### Remote Publishing Flow (Default)
1. Resolve package source (CWD, name, or path)
2. Load and validate `openpackage.yml` manifest
3. Validate version (stable semver only, no prereleases)
4. Authenticate with remote registry
5. Resolve package name (auto-scope with username if unscoped)
6. Collect package files from resolved source
7. Create tarball from collected files
8. Upload tarball to remote registry via `/packages/push` API endpoint
9. Display success with package details

### Local Publishing Flow
1. Resolve package source (CWD, name, or path)
2. Load and validate `openpackage.yml` manifest
3. Validate version (stable semver, allows prerelease warnings)
4. Collect package files from resolved source
5. Write files to local registry
6. Handle overwrite confirmation if version exists
7. Display success with source/destination details

## Options

### Common Options
- `[package]`: Package name or path (optional, defaults to CWD)
- `--force`: Overwrite existing version without confirmation
- `--local`: Publish to local registry instead of remote (default: remote)

### Remote-Only Options (Default Mode)
- `--profile <profile>`: Specify authentication profile (default: `default`)
- `--api-key <key>`: Override with direct API key (skips profile lookup)

## Authentication (Remote Only)

Remote publishing (default mode) requires authentication via one of:
- **Profile**: `--profile <name>` - Uses saved credentials from `opkg login`
- **API Key**: `--api-key <key>` - Direct API key override

See [Auth](../auth/) for authentication details.

## Package Scoping (Remote Only)

If package name in `openpackage.yml` is unscoped (no `@username/` prefix), remote publish (default mode) automatically adds your username scope:
- Manifest: `name: my-package`
- Published as: `@username/my-package`

If already scoped, uses the exact name from manifest:
- Manifest: `name: @myorg/my-package`
- Published as: `@myorg/my-package`

Local publishing (with `--local`) preserves the exact name from manifest (no auto-scoping).

See [Scope Management](../scope-management.md) for details.

## Version Requirements

### Remote Publishing (Default)
- **Required**: `openpackage.yml` must contain a `version` field
- **Valid semver**: Must be valid semantic version (e.g., `1.0.0`, `2.1.3`)
- **No prereleases**: Prerelease versions (e.g., `1.0.0-beta.1`) are rejected
- **No bumping**: Uses exact version from manifest (no auto-increment)

### Local Publishing
- **Required**: `openpackage.yml` must contain a `version` field
- **Valid semver**: Must be valid semantic version
- **Prereleases allowed**: Warnings shown but publishing proceeds

## File Collection

Publishes all files in source directory except:
- `.git/` and other VCS directories
- `node_modules/` and dependency directories
- Build artifacts and temporary files
- Files matching universal exclusion patterns

See [Registry Payload](../package/registry-payload-and-copy.md) for exclusion rules.

## Examples

## Errors

### No openpackage.yml
```
❌ No openpackage.yml found in current directory
   Run this command from a package root directory
```
**Solution**: Navigate to package directory or create `openpackage.yml`

### Package Not Found (When Using Name)
```
❌ Package 'my-package' not found.
   Searched: current directory, workspace packages (.openpackage/packages/), and global packages (~/.openpackage/packages/).
   Make sure the package exists in one of these locations.
```
**Solution**: Check package name or provide a path instead

### Tarball Input Rejected
```
❌ Local publish does not support tarball inputs.
   To publish from a tarball, first extract it to a directory.
```
**Solution**: Extract tarball first, then publish from directory

### Git Input Rejected
```
❌ Local publish does not support git inputs.
   To publish from a git repository, first clone it to a directory.
```
**Solution**: Clone repository first, then publish from directory

### Missing Name
```
❌ openpackage.yml must contain a name field
```
**Solution**: Add `name: my-package` to `openpackage.yml`

### Missing Version
```
❌ openpackage.yml must contain a version field to publish
```
**Solution**: Add `version: 1.0.0` to `openpackage.yml`

### Invalid Version
```
❌ Invalid version: abc. Provide a valid semver version.
```
**Solution**: Use valid semver format (e.g., `1.0.0`, `2.1.3`)

### Prerelease Version (Remote Only)
```
❌ Prerelease versions cannot be published: 1.0.0-beta.1
```
**Solution**: Remove prerelease suffix or publish locally first

### Already Exists (Without Force)
```
❌ Package my-package@1.2.0 already exists in registry (~/.openpackage/registry/my-package/1.2.0).
   Use --force to overwrite, or update the version in openpackage.yml.
```
**Solution**: Use `--force` flag or increment version

### Authentication Failed (Remote Only)
```
❌ Authentication failed. Run "opkg login" to configure credentials.
```
**Solution**: Run `opkg login` to authenticate or use `--api-key`

### Network Error (Remote Only)
```
❌ Network error: Unable to connect to registry
```
**Solution**: Check internet connection and registry availability

## Comparison: Remote vs Local

| Aspect | Remote Publishing (Default) | Local Publishing |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Destination** | Remote OpenPackage backend | Local registry or custom dir |
| **Authentication** | Required | Not required |
| **Network** | HTTPS upload | Local filesystem only |
| **Prerelease versions** | Rejected | Allowed (with warning) |
| **Auto-scoping** | Yes (if unscoped) | No |
| **Use Case** | Public distribution | Development, testing, local sharing |

## Integration
- **Replaces**: `pack` command (deprecated, removed)
- **Authentication**: Requires `opkg login` for remote mode
- **Manifest**: Uses same `openpackage.yml` format as other commands
- **File exclusion**: Respects universal file exclusion patterns
- **Package resolution**: Uses same resolution logic across commands

## Implementation
For implementation details, see:
- Main pipeline: `src/core/publish/publish-pipeline.ts`
- Local pipeline: `src/core/publish/local-publish-pipeline.ts`
- Upload (remote): `src/core/publish/publish-upload.ts`
- Errors: `src/core/publish/publish-errors.ts`
- Types: `src/core/publish/publish-types.ts`

## Related Commands

### Unpublish Command
The `opkg unpublish` command removes packages from registries. Key behaviors:
- **Default**: Attempts remote unpublish (currently not implemented)
- **Local mode**: `opkg unpublish <package[@version]> --local` removes from local registry
- **Interactive mode**: `opkg unpublish --interactive` auto-implies `--local` and provides interactive selection

Examples:
```bash
opkg unpublish my-package@1.0.0 --local      # Remove specific version from local
opkg unpublish my-package --local            # Remove all versions from local
opkg unpublish --interactive                 # Interactive selection (auto-implies --local)
opkg unpublish --interactive --force         # Interactive selection, skip confirmation
```

Note: Remote unpublish is not yet implemented. Use `--local` flag for local registry operations.
