### Save Pipeline Specs

This directory contains specifications for the **`save` behavior** in the model:

- `opkg save`: **Workspace → Source** (sync workspace edits back to a mutable package source)

These docs are **behavioral**: they describe features and logic, not specific modules or functions.

Key integration: Save ops use effective cwd (shell or --cwd; see [../../cli-options.md]) for workspace/package detection.

#### Pipeline Flow

`save` executes in this order:

1. **Read workspace index** → Load `.openpackage/openpackage.index.yml` and find mappings for the package
2. **Resolve package source** → Determine the source-of-truth path (`path:`/`git:`/registry) for the package
3. **Enforce mutability** → `save` must fail for immutable sources (registry paths)
4. **Build candidates from mappings** → Collect workspace candidates for the mapped file/dir keys
5. **Conflict resolution** → Choose which workspace candidate wins when multiple map to the same destination
6. **Write back to source** → Update the package source tree
