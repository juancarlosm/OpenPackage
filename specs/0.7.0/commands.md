---

## `save`

**Purpose**: Sync changes from workspace platform directories back to the package source.

**Direction**: Workspace → Source of Truth

**Preconditions**:
- Package must have a mutable source (`path:` pointing to packages/ directory)
- Fails for registry-installed packages

**Flow**:
```
1. Read package entry from unified openpackage.index.yml
2. Validate source is mutable (path is not in registry/)
3. Expand mappings and collect candidates:
   - File keys map directly (workspace target → source-relative path)
   - Directory keys expand by enumerating files under the mapped workspace directories
4. Resolve conflicts when multiple workspace candidates map to the same source path:
   - Platform-specific variants may override universal content (same platform override behavior as apply/install)
   - If multiple differing candidates remain, select using existing save behavior:
     - `--force`: pick latest by mtime
     - otherwise: prompt for selection
5. Write selected content back to the source tree
```

**Example**:
```bash
opkg save my-pkg

# Syncs:
#   .cursor/rules/auth.md → ~/.openpackage/packages/my-pkg/rules/auth.md
#   docs/guide.md → ~/.openpackage/packages/my-pkg/docs/guide.md
```

## `add`

**Purpose**: Add new files from workspace to package source.

**Direction**: Workspace → Source of Truth

**Preconditions**:
- Package must have a mutable source
- Source files must exist

**Flow**:
```
1. Validate source is mutable
2. Collect files from input path
3. Copy files into the package source directory using destination rules:
   - Platform files (e.g. `.cursor/rules/...`) map into universal subdirs (e.g. `rules/...`)
   - Platform root files (e.g. `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`) map to package root
   - All other workspace paths map into `root/<workspace-relpath>` (copy-to-root content)
4. Update unified openpackage.index.yml with new mappings
5. Optionally apply to other platforms (--apply)
```

**Example**:
```bash
opkg add my-pkg ./new-helpers/

# Copies:
#   ./new-helpers/utils.md → ~/.openpackage/packages/my-pkg/root/new-helpers/utils.md
```

---

## `pack`

**Purpose**: Create an immutable versioned snapshot from package source.

**Direction**: Source → Registry

**Flow**:
```
1. Read package source from path
2. Read version from source openpackage.yml
3. Copy to registry: ~/.openpackage/registry/<name>/<version>/
4. Mark as immutable (registry source)
```

**Example**:
```bash
opkg pack my-pkg

# Creates:
#   ~/.openpackage/registry/my-pkg/1.0.0/
#   ├── openpackage.yml
#   ├── commands/
#   └── rules/
```

**Options**:
- `--output <path>`: Copy the snapshot directly into `<path>` (i.e., `<path>` becomes the package root for the snapshot; no `<name>/<version>` subdirs are added)
- `--dry-run`: Show what would be packed without writing

---

## `apply`

**Purpose**: Sync package content to workspace platform directories.

**Direction**: Source/Registry → Workspace

**Flow**:
```
1. Resolve package source path from openpackage.yml
2. Read package files from source
3. Map to platform directories (.cursor/, .opencode/, etc.)
4. Write/update files
5. Update unified openpackage.index.yml
```

**Example**:
```bash
opkg apply my-pkg

# Syncs from source to:
#   .cursor/rules/
#   .cursor/commands/
#   .opencode/rules/
#   etc.
```

---

## `install`

**Purpose**: Install a package from registry to workspace.

**Direction**: Registry → Workspace

**Flow**:
```
1. Resolve version from registry
2. Locate registry directory: ~/.openpackage/registry/<name>/<version>/
3. Apply files to workspace platforms
4. Update workspace openpackage.yml with dependency:
   - Registry installs: preserve the requested `version` constraint (range or exact) and do not write `path:` (it is inferred)
   - Git/path installs: do not write ranges; persist the source (`git`/`ref` or `path`) and any version written must be exact
5. Update unified openpackage.index.yml with file mappings
```

**Example**:
```bash
opkg install community-pkg@^1.2.0

# Reads from:
#   ~/.openpackage/registry/community-pkg/1.2.3/

# Updates openpackage.yml:
#   packages:
#     - name: community-pkg
#       version: ^1.2.0
```

---

## `status`

**Purpose**: Show status of all installed packages.

**Flow**:
```
1. Read unified openpackage.index.yml
2. For each package:
   - Validate source path exists
   - Compare source-of-truth files to mapped workspace targets using content hashes
   - Report sync state and path
```

**Example**:
```bash
opkg status

# Output:
# ✅ my-rules@1.0.0  synced    ./.openpackage/packages/my-rules/
# ⚠️ my-rules@1.0.0  modified  ./.openpackage/packages/my-rules/
# ❌ my-rules@1.0.0  missing   ./.openpackage/packages/my-rules/
```

---

## `uninstall`

**Purpose**: Remove a package from workspace.

**Flow**:
```
1. Read package entry from unified openpackage.index.yml
2. Delete all mapped files from workspace (only those paths; never delete the package source directory)
3. Update root files (AGENTS.md / platform root files) by removing the package-marked section
3. Remove package entry from openpackage.index.yml
4. Remove dependency from openpackage.yml
```
