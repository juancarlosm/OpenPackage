### Apply – `package.index.yml` Effects

#### 1. Overview

Apply/sync updates `package.index.yml` to reflect the **actual installed paths** created by apply. This is the mechanism by which the index “expands” from a single source path (recorded by add) to multiple platform paths (after apply).

For the index file format and general semantics, see `../package/package-index-yml.md`.

#### 2. Index update behavior by operation

| Operation | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| **Add** | Records only the source path used to add the file (e.g., `.cursor/...`). |
| **Apply** | Updates the index to include all platform paths where files were actually created/updated during apply. |
| **Save** | Writes a registry snapshot; index expansion requires apply (via `save --apply` or separate `apply`). |
| **Install** | Populates/updates the index with installed paths as part of install. |

#### 3. Before/After examples

**After `opkg add .cursor/commands/test.md`** (only source path recorded):

```yaml
workspace:
  hash: abc123
  version: 1.0.0-abc123.xyz
files:
  commands/test.md:
    - .cursor/commands/test.md    # Only the source path that exists
```

**After `opkg apply`** (all synced paths recorded):

```yaml
workspace:
  hash: abc123
  version: 1.0.0-abc123.xyz
files:
  commands/test.md:
    - .cursor/commands/test.md    # Original source
    - .opencode/command/test.md   # Synced by apply
  rules/auth.md:
    - .cursor/rules/auth.mdc
  # Note: package.yml is NOT included (it's the manifest, not synced content)
  # Note: <dir>/helper.md is SKIPPED for root packages (maps to itself)
```

**Nested package** (`cwd/.openpackage/packages/foo/.openpackage/package.index.yml`):

```yaml
workspace:
  hash: abc123
  version: 1.0.0
files:
  commands/test.md:
    - .cursor/commands/test.md
    - .opencode/command/test.md
  <dir>/helper.md:
    - <dir>/helper.md
  AGENTS.md:
    - AGENTS.md
```

#### 4. Notes

- The index expands to include other platform paths only **after apply/sync runs** (e.g., `opkg apply` or `opkg save --apply`).
