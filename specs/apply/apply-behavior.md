### Apply – Behavior

#### 1. Definition

**Apply** (also referred to as platform apply/sync) projects a package’s canonical content into **platform-specific workspace locations** based on detected platforms and platform mapping rules.

Apply may be invoked:

- explicitly via `opkg apply`, or
- as a post-step of `opkg save --apply`.

---

#### 2. Purpose

- Keep platform-specific working directories (e.g. `.cursor/`, `.opencode/`, etc.) consistent with the package’s canonical content.
- Ensure `openpackage.index.yml` reflects the **paths that actually exist** after apply.

---

#### 3. Operations

Apply distinguishes between:

- **Create / Update**: write new or changed files to platform-specific targets.
- **Delete**: remove stale files that were previously installed by the package but no longer exist in the package snapshot.

Apply runs against the set of platforms detected for the effective cwd.

---

#### 4. Timing

Apply only runs after:

- Package detection and name resolution are complete.
- Version and file selection have succeeded.
- (When invoked as `save --apply`) the registry write has completed successfully.

---

#### 5. Root Package Considerations

- Root packages may skip root-level “self mappings” (where a registry key would map to the exact same on-disk path) to avoid redundant index entries and no-op writes.
- Root file syncing (e.g., platform-specific root files) may be skipped for root packages when appropriate to avoid syncing “back into itself”.

Nested packages:

- Always participate fully in apply/sync when apply is requested; their changes are projected out to platform workspaces.

---

#### 6. Error Reporting

Failures in apply are surfaced to the user as part of the command result, along with a summary of created/updated/removed paths.

See `conflicts.md` for how apply handles conflicts and interactive prompts.
