### Workspace Index File (`.openpackage/openpackage.index.yml`)

The `openpackage.index.yml` file is the **unified workspace index**. It tracks:

- Installed packages (by name)
- Each package’s resolved **source path**
- Optional resolved **version**
- The file/directory mapping from **package-relative paths** to **workspace paths that were actually written**

---

#### Location

- **Workspace-local metadata**: `cwd/.openpackage/openpackage.index.yml`

> **Note**: `openpackage.index.yml` is **never** included in the registry payload. It's workspace-local metadata.

---

#### Excluded Content

The following files are **never** included in the index, even though they may exist in the package:

| File | Reason |
|------|--------|
| `openpackage.yml` | Package manifest; not synced as a regular content file |
| `openpackage.index.yml` | Index file itself; workspace-local metadata |

The index only contains entries for content that is **actually synced** to workspace locations.

#### Structure

```yaml
# This file is managed by OpenPackage. Do not edit manually.

packages:
  <package-name>:
    path: <declared-path>        # string from openpackage.yml (relative or ~) or inferred registry path
    version: <installed-version> # optional semver string
    dependencies:                # optional cached direct deps (names)
      - <dep-name>
    files:
      <registry-key>:
        - <installed-path>       # Simple mapping (string)
        - target: <installed-path>  # Complex mapping (object)
          merge: deep            # Merge strategy (if applicable)
          keys:                  # Tracked keys (if applicable)
            - key.path.1
            - key.path.2
```

**File mapping formats:**

1. **Simple mapping** (string): For files owned entirely by one package
   ```yaml
   rules/typescript.md:
     - .cursor/rules/typescript.md
   ```

2. **Complex mapping** (object): For merged files with key-level tracking
   ```yaml
   mcp.jsonc:
     - target: .opencode/opencode.json
       merge: deep
       keys:
         - mcp.server1
         - mcp.server2
   ```

The index can contain both formats mixed, depending on how each file was installed.

---

#### Registry Keys

Registry keys are **relative to the package root**:

| Content Type | Key Format | Example |
|--------------|------------|---------|
| Universal content | `<subdir>/<file>` | `commands/test.md` |
| Root files | `<filename>` | `AGENTS.md` |
| `root/` directory (direct copy) | `root/<path>` | `root/tools/helper.sh` |
| Directory mapping | `<dir>/` (trailing slash) | `rules/` |

---

#### Values (Installed Paths)

Values are **relative to the workspace root (`cwd`)** and represent **paths that actually exist**:

| Content Type | Value Format | Example |
|--------------|--------------|---------|
| Universal content | Platform-specific paths | `.cursor/commands/test.md`, `.opencode/commands/test.md` |
| Root files | Same as key | `AGENTS.md` |
| `root/` directory (direct copy) | Strip `root/` prefix | `tools/helper.sh` |
| Directory mapping | Workspace directory paths (end with `/`) | `.claude/rules/`, `.cursor/rules/` |

> **Important**: The index only records paths where files **actually exist**. If a file is only installed to one platform (e.g., `.cursor/`), only that path appears in the index—not hypothetical paths for other platforms.

---

#### Key Tracking for Merged Files

When packages use flow-based transformations with merge strategies, the index tracks the specific keys each package contributes:

**When keys are tracked:**
- Flow uses `merge: 'deep'` or `merge: 'shallow'`
- Target file will be shared by multiple packages

**When keys are NOT tracked:**
- `merge: 'replace'` - whole file owned by one package (simple string mapping)
- `merge: 'composite'` - delimiter-based tracking used instead
- Simple file copy - no merge (simple string mapping)

**Example with key tracking:**

```yaml
packages:
  my-mcp-package:
    path: ~/.openpackage/packages/my-mcp-package/1.0.0/
    version: 1.0.0
    files:
      # Simple file mapping (no merge)
      rules/typescript.md:
        - .cursor/rules/typescript.md
      
      # Complex mapping with key tracking
      mcp.jsonc:
        - target: .opencode/opencode.json
          merge: deep
          keys:
            - mcp.server1
            - mcp.server2
```

**Key notation:** Dot-notation represents nested object paths:
- `mcp.server1` → `{ mcp: { server1: {...} } }`
- `editor.fontSize` → `{ editor: { fontSize: 14 } }`
- `servers.db.host` → `{ servers: { db: { host: "..." } } }`

**Purpose:** Enables precise removal during uninstall. Only the tracked keys are removed from the target file, preserving content from other packages.

See [Uninstall](../uninstall/README.md) for details on key-based removal.

#### Index Update Behavior

The unified workspace index is updated differently depending on the operation:

| Operation | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| **Add** | Does **not** update the index. Add operates on package sources independently of workspace installation state. To sync added files to workspace and update the index, run `install`. |
| **Install** | Writes/updates `packages[<name>].files` based on what was installed. |
| **Remove** | Does **not** update the index. Remove operates on package sources independently of workspace installation state. To sync deletions to workspace and update the index, run `install`. |

This ensures the index reflects the **current state** of the workspace, not hypothetical future states.

**Key principle**: The index is a record of what exists in the workspace, not what exists in package sources. Commands that materialize content to the workspace (`install`) update the index. Commands that only modify sources (`add`, `remove`) do not.
