### Nested Packages and Parent Packages

#### Workspace Structure with Nested Packages

#### Key Rules

- Each `.openpackage/packages/<name>/` directory is its **own canonical package root**, with:
  - Its own `openpackage.yml` at the package root (marks it as a package)
  - Its own universal subdirs at the package root (e.g., `commands/`, `rules/`)
  - Its own root-level content (root files, `root/` directory, etc.)

- The **parent root package never inlines** `.openpackage/packages/<name>/` into its own payload.

- Registry entries for `alpha` and `beta` are created **independently** from their respective package roots.

- **Only the workspace root package** can have a `.openpackage/packages/` directory. Nested packages cannot have further nested packages.

#### Package Root Locations

| Package Type | Package Root Path |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Workspace root | `cwd/` |
| Nested `alpha` | `cwd/.openpackage/packages/alpha/` |
| Nested `beta` | `cwd/.openpackage/packages/beta/` |

---

#### Identical Internal Structure

Both root and nested packages have **identical internal structure**:

```text
<package-root>/
  openpackage.yml
  <universal-subdirs>/
  <root-level-content>/
  <root-files>
```

This uniformity ensures packages can be:
- Moved between workspace root and nested locations
- Copied to/from registry without structural changes
- Processed by the same code paths regardless of location
